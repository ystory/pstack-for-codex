# pstack-for-codex

An unofficial Codex adaptation of [Lauren Tan's pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) workflows, skills, and agents. It also bundles the `control-ui`, `control-cli`, and `deslop` skills from [cursor-team-kit](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/cursor-team-kit). Both upstream snapshots are pinned, and Codex adaptations are tracked as reproducible patches.

Ordinary roles default to Sol 6.1 through Codex. The hardest tasks use Opus 5.5 through an existing Claude Code CLI, and candidate and review panels use both models. The default configuration requires an installed, authenticated Claude Code CLI with Opus 5.5 access.

Setup can save an all-Sol configuration, but that configuration cannot satisfy upstream steps requiring a different model or model family, such as the final audit in `show-me-your-work` and the eval playbook. See the [plugin manifest](plugin/plugin.json) for the current version and the [compatibility notes](docs/spec.md) for verified workflows and limitations.

## Requirements

- Codex with plugin and native subagent support, signed in to an account with access to your selected models.
- Git for Codex to fetch the GitHub marketplace.
- Node.js 24.12+ for setup and the bundled runtime helpers.
- Python 3.11+ for agent registration, using its standard-library TOML parser. Setup uses `python3` by default and can select another existing interpreter.
- An installed, authenticated Claude Code CLI 2.1.280+ with Opus 5.5 access for the default Claude roles. Setup checks CLI capabilities; detection alone does not establish model access.
- Bun 1.2+ for the orchestration and PR watcher helpers. Their first use installs locked dependencies in a cache outside the plugin and may need network access. GitHub PR workflows also need an authenticated GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## Install

Add the GitHub marketplace, then install the plugin:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/ystory/pstack-for-codex.git
codex plugin add pstack-for-codex@pstack-for-codex
```

Codex reads the repository's marketplace catalog and installs the committed `plugin/` directory. You do not need to clone the repository, install project dependencies, or build it first. See [Development and maintenance](docs/stack.md) to build and verify a local artifact instead.

## Set up and use

Open a Codex chat in your project and run:

```text
$pstack-for-codex:setup-pstack
```

Setup registers the two bundled agents and a general-purpose role, then saves your reasoning budget and role choices in `$CODEX_HOME/pstack-for-codex/models.json` (default `~/.codex/pstack-for-codex/models.json`). It preserves unrelated settings and stops on conflicts with user-edited managed files or declarations.

After setup, start a new chat so Codex discovers the registered roles. For a first walkthrough, try:

```text
$pstack-for-codex:how explain how this project starts up.
```

Use `$pstack-for-codex:poteto-mode` at the start of a development task to select a playbook, or `$pstack-for-codex:poteto-help` to find a suitable workflow. The [pstack guide](plugin/docs/guide/README.md) covers prompting, review, verification, and longer runs.

## Update or restore

For a GitHub installation, refresh the Git marketplace and explicitly reinstall the plugin:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace upgrade pstack-for-codex
codex plugin add pstack-for-codex@pstack-for-codex
```

Run `$pstack-for-codex:setup-pstack` again to synchronize its managed registrations, then start a new chat. Saved model choices are retained.

To switch an existing local `pstack-for-codex` marketplace to GitHub, run the two [install commands](#install) above, then rerun setup and start a new chat. Adding the Git URL selects that source for the same marketplace identity; `marketplace upgrade` alone does not turn a local source into a Git source. For building, selecting, or restoring local artifacts, see [Development and maintenance](docs/stack.md#build-and-select-an-artifact).

Before restoring an older all-Sol bundle, use the current setup to explicitly save Codex-only role choices: older helpers reject the mixed-executor schema 2, while native-only schema 1 remains compatible. This does not make all-Sol choices satisfy steps that require a different model or model family.

## Remove

Before removing the plugin, run `$pstack-for-codex:setup-pstack` and ask it to unregister its managed agents. This removes unchanged owned registrations and leaves your model preferences in place. Then remove the plugin:

```sh
codex plugin remove pstack-for-codex@pstack-for-codex
```

There is no automatic uninstall hook to clean up registered agents after the plugin is removed.

## Development and sources

For contributions:

1. Keep the pinned `upstream/` snapshots unchanged during adaptation work. Review source updates through the [upstream candidate workflow](docs/stack.md#review-an-upstream-update).
2. Implement Codex adaptations in `plugin/`, record them in a new patch, and [verify patch replay](docs/stack.md#record-an-adaptation).

- [Design and compatibility](docs/spec.md): adaptation behavior, source invariants, and verified runtime scope.
- [Development and maintenance](docs/stack.md): verification, patch management, upstream candidates, and artifact commands. The full verification workflow also requires `tar`.
- [Original pstack README](upstream/pstack/README.md): upstream project background.
- [pstack source lock](upstream.lock.json) and [cursor-team-kit source lock](dependencies.lock.json): pinned revisions and hashes.

The bundled cursor-team-kit skills retain Cursor's [MIT license](upstream/cursor-team-kit/LICENSE). Their original copyright and license notices are preserved in the distribution.
